My learning app lets users pick a subject they want to study and set a timeframe (like a week, month, or year) to achieve their goal. 
As they progress, they can track each day by marking it as “learned” (meaning they studied) or “freezed” (meaning they took a break). 
This way, users can see how consistent they’ve been, making it easier to stay motivated and reach their learning goals.
